    With this plugin, you can connect to a XenServer installation to stand up VMs for your jobs.  Once a VM is created, it will connect to 
		the Jenkins master as a slave and the slave's label will be exposed as the "XEN_VM_LABEL" environment variable.  This can be passed 
		to other plugins (NodeLabel plugin).
